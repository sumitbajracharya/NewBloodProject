   <h4>Why should we donate blood?</h4>
<p class="text-justify">
Blood contains many life-saving components that can help to treat different illnesses and injuries. For many people, blood donors are their life-line. Blood donation gives a proud feeling of touching someone's life in such a beautiful way. It's an experience that no words can define. You have to donate blood yourself to find out. You also benefit in other ways by donating blood as it reduces the chances of ischemic heart diseases (beginning of heart problems) as frequent donations reduce the accumulated and unwanted iron load from the body. Your blood donation will also get you your blood insurance from us. By keeping the blood line flowing, you will greatly contribute towards a healthier, happier society. Do remember, any one may require blood any time including ourselves and our dear ones.

    <h4>Is Donating Blood Safe?</h4>
 <p class="text-justify">
Blood donation takes only about 45 minutes and it is a safe procedure. In general, blood donation, whether whole blood or aphaeresis does not usually have significant adverse effects on a donor's health. Donors give about 10-12% of their circulating blood volume during each blood donation. Healthy adult donors who meet the required screening criteria should be able to donate safely and regularly. If you ask any regular blood donor about it, a small percentage of first time donors may psychologically feel a little dizzy but only for a few minutes. The Doctors staff at the blood drive will ensure that your first blood donation is a happy experience.<br /><br />

    <h4>Can I get any disease like AIDS or Hepatitis or any other disease by Blood donation?</h4>
 <p class="text-justify">
That is impossible. We use only brand new, sterile, disposable needles for each and every donor. These needles are discarded after each use. Donors can therefore never catch any infectious diseases from blood donation. This totally eliminates any remote chance of catching any disease from blood donation.<br /><br />
 
 </p>


    <h4>How much Blood and how often can I donate?</h4>
 <p class="text-justify">
You can donate blood every 12 weeks, up to 4 times a year. Eligible donors (any body between 18 to 60 years of age and leading a healthy life) with weight above 50 kgs. can donate up to 450 ml of blood. Your body can replenish this volume within 24 hours.
</p>



    <h4>How frequently can I donate Blood?</h4>
Males — Every 3 months.
    <br />
    Females — Every 4 months.




    <h4>Why should I become a regular blood donor? </h4>
    <p class="text-justify">
As you know, blood is a life saving medicine, which works wonders in certain medical treatments, and life threatening situations. Our society is today threatened by scarcity of blood and the only blood source today is human being. This issue has got further complexes by professional donors, who donate blood for money. These donors have contributed towards rapid spread of killer diseases like AIDS, Hepatitis B & Hepatitis C in the society. Your regular donation will go a long way in salvaging the situation.

    <h4>What Types of Blood Donation are There?</h4>
    <p class="text-justify">
    <strong>General Blood Donation</strong><br />

450-mL, or less than 1 pint, of whole blood is collected from each donor in a plastic bag that contains an anticoagulant preservative.<br /><br />

    <strong>Apheresis Component Donation</strong><br />

Apheresis is a specialized form of blood donation in which only one specific blood component (platelets, plasma or red cells) are extracted from the donor. It is slightly more physically demanding than a whole blood donation. The process is also longer, about 45 to 90 minutes.
Donate Blood Plasma can be carried on very casually. After donating the blood you can even go for work. The blood volume or plasma is replaced within a day. Four to eight weeks are needed for complete replacement of the red cells.
